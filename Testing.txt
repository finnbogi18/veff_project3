Ideas for testing:

Try all methods(obvious...)
Try to read an event that has been deleted
try to read a booking that has been deleted
try to read a booking of an event that has been deleted
check if the capacity has changed after deleting a booking
Try all sorts of strange inputs in the requests, int, float, string, array? code?(try to crash the server)
Check if it is possible to change an event if someone has booked it
Check if it is possible to change an event after all bookings have been deleted
